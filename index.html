            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <div class="about-grid">
                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>With over 34 years of experience in the hospitality industry, I have built my career from the ground upâ€”starting as a <b>Restaurant Cashier with the Taj Group of Hotels</b> in August 1990. Early in my journey, I gained exposure to multiple fine dining outlets including Southern Spice (Indian cuisine), Jockey Club (Continental), and Memories of China (Chinese cuisine). My responsibilities included bill preparation and payment handling. Due to my performance, I was entrusted with guest checkouts, eventually being promoted to Front Office Cashier in 1992 and later to <b>Senior Front Office Cashier (Supervisor)</b> in 1995.</p>

<p>In the same year, I joined The Capitol, a newly launched four-star property, as <b>Duty Manager</b>. Over the next few years, I was promoted to <b>Assistant Front Office Manager</b>, developed and implemented the property's first SOPs, and also took on Sales, Marketing, and Banquets. In 2000, I was promoted to <b>Front Office Manager</b>, took on additional charge of Housekeeping, and served twice as <b>Acting General Manager</b>.</p>

<p>My leadership journey continued as Resident Manager at Hotel Infantry Court in 2003, a 72-room three-star property under the Choice Group. I led a successful turnaround by <b>repositioning it as a standalone hotel</b>, revamping operations, and significantly boosting performance. I was promoted to <b>General Manager</b> within a year.</p>

<p>Later, I moved to Evoma, a pioneering hotel-cum-serviced office space in Bangalore. I <b>launched the 67-room property</b> with over 250 office seats and multiple event spaces, gaining valuable experience in leasing and managing hybrid spaces, especially catering to startups.</p>

<p>In 2009, I joined 37th Crescent, a boutique 60-room hotel, where I revitalized business by building a strong sales team and re-establishing the brand among corporate clients. The following year, I became <b>Vice President</b> of Citadel Hotels, overseeing two properties and <b>growing their business sixfold</b> through aggressive market positioning and strategic initiatives.</p>

<p>My longest tenure was with Sterlings Mac, a proposed five-star property, where I served for 14 years and 5 months. I launched the property, developed restaurants, banquet halls, and suites from scratch, and earned a <b>Five-Star classification three consecutive times</b>. I created SOPs, hired and trained the entire team, set up an efficient Sales and Marketing division, and competed successfully against established international hotel chains. Under my leadership, the property grew from zero revenue in 2010 to <b>â‚¹4.25 crores per month</b> in 2024, even after overcoming the challenges posed by the pandemic.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have gained hands-on experience in nearly every aspect of hotel operationsâ€”from Front Office, Housekeeping, Sales & Marketing, to Project Launches and Strategic Planning. I take pride in having launched and repositioned multiple properties, turned around underperforming units, and led diverse teams to success.</p>

<p> Now, having completed a fulfilling and dynamic career in hotel operations and leadership, I have transitioned into hospitality consulting. With the wealth of knowledge and hands-on experience I've gained over the past three decades â€” <b>launching properties, building teams, creating SOPs, driving sales, and turning around underperforming hotels</b> â€” I am now focused on helping others succeed in the hospitality industry. Whether you're launching a new property, restructuring operations, or looking to boost profitability, I am open to sharing my expertise and supporting businesses in achieving operational excellence and sustainable growth. </p>
